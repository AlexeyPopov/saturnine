   Saturnine is a Clojure library to assist in developing server applications
   in a message-passing style.  It is built on top of JBoss Netty, and inherits 
   a number of features from this framework, including trivial configuration in
   blocking or non-blocking modes and SSL/TLS support (with starttls).  Here's 
   a simple REPL server:

     (use 'saturnine)

     (defserver repl-server 1234 :string :print :clj :echo)

     (start repl-server :nonblocking)

   Here's a slighlty more complex sum-calculating server that implements a 
   custom Handler:

     (defhandler Sum [sum]
       (upstream [msg] (let [new-sum (+ sum msg)]
                         (send-down (str \"Sum is \" new-sum \"\\r\\n\"))
                         (assoc this :sum new-sum))))

     (defserver sum-server 1234 :string :clj (Sum 0))
